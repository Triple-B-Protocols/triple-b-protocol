# Executive Summary

The Triple-B Protocol (Bitcoin Bearer Bond) is a cryptographically secure, Bitcoin-native protocol for issuing, transferring, and redeeming digital bearer bonds as NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain. This v0.1 draft presents a comprehensive specification, including:

- Secure issuer and participant onboarding
- Settlement and verification flows with zero-knowledge proofs
- Coupon payment and NFT evolution mechanisms
- Redemption, secondary market transfer (atomic swaps), and physical bearer extensions
- Advanced multi-party and institutional flows

The protocol leverages BGV homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, Schnorr/adaptor signatures, and Ordinals technology to ensure privacy, auditability, and trustless operation. All protocol flows are rigorously diagrammed and analysed for security and real-world feasibility.

This draft is now ready for internal peer review and community feedback. Next steps include further formalisation, reference implementation, and integration of additional research insights as the protocol matures towards production readiness.

## Motivation for Decentralised Debt Instruments

Traditional debt markets and even most DeFi systems rely on centralised validation, opaque reputation systems, or external oracles. Triple-B breaks this paradigm, enabling:

- Self-issued, programmable bearer bonds as Bitcoin-native NFTs
- On-chain, immutable credit histories and coupon records
- Trustless, cryptographically enforced commitments
-   On-chain, immutable credit histories and coupon records
-   Trustless, cryptographically enforced commitments

## Key Innovations

-   BGV homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving aggregation
-   Recursive, evolving inscriptions for dynamic NFT state
-   Zero-knowledge proofs for verifiable computation and privacy
-   Ordinals and Taproot for Bitcoin-native programmability

## Guiding Principles Alignment

Triple-B is built to empower individuals and organizations to "Write Your Own Financial Future," enabling direct, transparent, and mathematically enforced financial relationships.
